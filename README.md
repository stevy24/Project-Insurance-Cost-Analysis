data analytics on a medical insurance charges dataset. This is a filtered and modified version of the Medical Insurance Price Prediction dataset, available under the CC0 1.0 Universal License on the Kaggle website.

Objectives
In this project, we will:

* Load the data as a pandas dataframe
* Clean the data, taking care of the blank entries
* Run exploratory data analysis and identify the attributes that most affect the charges
* Develop single variable and multi variable Linear Regression models for predicting the charges
* Use Ridge regression to refine the performance of Linear regression models.
